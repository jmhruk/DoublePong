# What is Double Pong?

Double pong is a game of pong that lets each player (up to 2) control two paddles each.
This adds a horizontal element to the game effectively playing two games of pong at once but at the same time!

# How to play:
1. Download the Source Code
2. Install the required libraries
3. Run main.py either through an IDE or through CLI
4. When you run main.py it will be a black screen, please click the spacebar to start the game.
5. Use W,A,S,D for Player 1 Controls and UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT Arrow Keys for Player 2 Controls.
        OR
You can also download the .exe file although it may be slightly slower.

NOTE: This is my first attempt at making a game in PyGame so there are probably quite a few errors.
